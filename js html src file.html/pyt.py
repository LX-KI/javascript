# # #     # a function is sequence of statements thta performs computation 
# # #     # when u define a function you specify the name and sequence of ststements and later can call the fnction by name 
# # #     # there are several reasons to use a function 
# # #     # 1) creating anew function gives you an oppurtunity to name a group of stements which makes yr program easier to read and debug 
# # #     #2) function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetative code later if u make achange u only have to amke it in one place 
# # #     #3) dividing a long program into functions allows u to debug , departs one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole 
# # #     #4) well defined function are often useful for many programs once u write and debug once and we can reuse it 

# # # # Functions _1)Built in 
# # #           # _2)user defined

# # Q) write a program to accept3 values from the udser and to calculate the product of 1st and 3rd num and the remainder of 2nd num with the product 

# a= input("enter the 1st value")

# c= input("enter the 3rd value")
# int(a)
# int(b)
# int(c)
